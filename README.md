# Handwritten-Text-Extraction
A machine learning-based project for handwritten text recognition. This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction. It is built to recognize and transcribe handwritten text from images, trained on the IAM Line Dataset, achieving an accuracy of 42%.
